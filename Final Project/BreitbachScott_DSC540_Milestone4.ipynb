    "My next backup plan was BeerMapping.com. I as able to obtain an API key and I spent a fair amount of time submitting updates to their database for breweries. This week, their website went down, so I went back to BreweryDB's sandbox. Once I got my code figured out for retrieving the data I wanted, I did a search for Nebraska, which returned 0 results. I was able to return a handful of breweries from Colorado, so I know the code was working, unfortunately there were just no Nebraska breweries in the sandbox.  \n",
